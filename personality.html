      <h2 id="traits">Top 3 Personality Traits</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Drives continuous learning; helps when debugging and researching new libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Keeps me consistent with study and project deadlines, improving deliverables.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative mindset:</strong> I work well in teams—pair programming and clear communication help projects succeed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How these affect my academic life</h3>
      <p>I apply curiosity by exploring new backend patterns; discipline helps meet assignment deadlines; collaboration improves code quality and learning speed.</p>

      <h2 id="hero">My Hero</h2>
      <p><strong>Hero:</strong> My older cousin (fictionalized for privacy) — a software engineer who mentors and encourages learning.</p>
      <p>What I admire: patience teaching complex concepts, focus on good documentation, and habit of testing code early.</p>

    <section class="section-card" aria-labelledby="ai-idea">
      <h2 id="ai-idea">AI Businesses of 2025 — Reflection</h2>
      <p>I reviewed several idea lists for promising AI businesses in 2025 (for example: AI-powered personalized learning platforms). Sources include industry summaries and idea lists. See references page for details.</p>

      <h3>Favourite idea: AI‑powered Personalized Learning Platforms</h3>
      <p>Why: Personalized learning tailors content to students' pace and style; it can increase engagement and learning efficiency by offering adaptive practice and feedback. (See idea articles and trend reports.)</p>

      <h4>How it applies to my world</h4>
      <p>As a future software engineer, I can build backend services that serve adaptive content, implement recommendation algorithms, and ensure scalable APIs for mobile and web clients.</p>

      <h4>Ethical issues</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> Student data is highly sensitive — must be protected and minimised.</li>
        <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Models trained on narrow samples can disadvantage marginalized students.</li>
        <li><strong>Access equity:</strong> Paid services can widen education gaps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>My proposed mitigations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Data minimization & encryption; store only necessary learning signals, and anonymize when possible.</li>
        <li>Regular bias audits and diverse training data; involve educators in evaluation.</li>
        <li>Offer tiered pricing or non-profit partnerships (example: Khan Academy's Khanmigo provides a model for ethical deployment).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example app: <a class="external" href="https://www.khanmigo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khanmigo (Khan Academy)</a>. Khanmigo is an AI tutor designed for education contexts and explicitly discusses safety and privacy considerations. See references.</p>
